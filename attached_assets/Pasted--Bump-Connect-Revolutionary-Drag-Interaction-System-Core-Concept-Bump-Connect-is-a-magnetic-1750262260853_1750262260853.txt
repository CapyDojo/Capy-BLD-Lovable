🎯 Bump & Connect: Revolutionary Drag Interaction System
Core Concept
"Bump & Connect" is a magnetic drag interaction that transforms boring entity relationship building into an intuitive, delightful experience. Instead of complex menus or manual connection tools, users simply drag entities close to each other and they "bump" together to create connections automatically.
The Magic Interaction Flow
1. Grab & Drag 🖱️

User drags any entity (company, person, trust, etc.)
All other entities immediately become "magnetic targets"
Visual magnetic fields appear around potential connection points

2. Magnetic Detection Zones 🎯
Three progressive zones with distinct visual feedback:

🔍 Detection Zone (80px radius): Subtle white pulsing rings appear
⚡ Strong Pull Zone (40px radius): Bright gold rings with faster pulse, target entity "breathes" with golden glow
🎯 Snap Zone (20px radius): Bright green rings with rapid pulse, animated connection preview line appears

3. Auto-Bump Connection ✨

When dragged entity enters 20px snap zone: automatic connection creation
New ownership relationship appears instantly with default percentage
Success celebration animation (green pulse effect)
No clicking, no menus, no manual connection drawing required

4. Smart Interaction Logic 🧠

Duplicate prevention: Won't create duplicate connections
Visual feedback: Real-time status updates ("Searching..." → "In Field" → "Ready to Connect!")
Smooth performance: 60fps calculations with optimized distance detection
Touch optimized: Works perfectly on mobile with finger dragging

Why This is Revolutionary for Legal Tech
🎪 Transforms Boring into Delightful

Traditional: Click source → click target → choose relationship type → set percentage
Bump & Connect: Drag → bump → done! Feels like a game, not work

⚡ Reduces Cognitive Load

No complex UI to learn - dragging is universal human interaction
Visual magnetic fields show exactly what will happen before it happens
Progressive feedback guides users naturally through the interaction

🎯 Perfect for Complex Entity Structures

Fast iteration: Quickly try different ownership structures
Visual clarity: See relationships forming in real-time
Error prevention: Smart logic prevents impossible connections

Technical Implementation Notes

Distance calculations: Real-time Pythagorean theorem for proximity detection
Visual effects: CSS animations with magnetic field rings and breathing targets
State management: Clean separation between drag state and connection logic
Performance: Optimized for smooth 60fps interactions even with many entities

User Experience Goals

Intuitive: Works exactly like users expect from physical world experience
Satisfying: Each successful connection feels rewarding and accomplished
Professional: Sophisticated enough for legal professionals, delightful enough to love
Efficient: Dramatically faster than traditional relationship building tools

The "Aha!" Moment
When users first drag an entity and see the magnetic fields appear, then experience the smooth progression from detection → pull → snap → connection, they immediately understand this isn't just another boring enterprise tool. It's a lovable, huggable interface that makes complex legal work feel approachable and even fun.
This is the signature interaction that will make Capy unforgettable and beloved by legal professionals worldwide. 🎯⚡✨
